# debounce-n-throttle

![Tests](https://github.com/sekoyo/debounce-n-throttle/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

For when you only need Lodash's debounce and throttle but existing Typescript alternatives are poor imitations.

```ts
import { debounce, throttle } from 'debounce-n-throttle'
```

The functions are almost identical to the lodash ones and the same tests pass.
